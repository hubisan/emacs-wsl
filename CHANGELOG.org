*** [[https://github.com/hubisan/emacs-wsl/compare/v1.2.0...v1.3.0][1.3.0]] - 2023-12-13

- =REMOVED= Chapters for WSL1. WSL2 is very easy to install and a link to the documentation is all there is needed.

- =CHANGED= Updated the instructions how to install Emacs from source and updated it to Emacs 29.1.

- =CHANGED= Adapted instructions to use Emacs version 28.1 instead of 27.2.
- =CHANGED= Using native compilation flag. Just remove it if you don't want it.
  It works very well on my setup (WSL 1 and Ubuntu 20.04).
- =ADDED= New dependencies from the snap including those needed for native
  compilation.
- =REMOVED= The batch scripts to install Emacs. Better do it in the terminal
  as there might be some packages missing or other errors.
- =ADDED= Instructions to use the latest snapshot of Emacs.
- =ADDED= Remark about WSLg when using Windows 11.
- =CHANGED= Made the VcXsrv section a child of the run Emacs section.
