This guide shows you how to run Emacs with the Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL
in Windows 10. Emacs can either be run with a graphical display or directly in
the terminal.

This guide is using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS as Linux distrubition and lxde as desktop.

* Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux

#+begin_quote
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
#+end_quote

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following to enable the feature:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
#+END_SRC

Restart your computer (you should be prompted to do so).

This can also be done with:

- Open Control Panel
- Programs and Features
- Turn Windows Feature on or off
- Check Windows Subsystem for Linux

* Install the Linux distribution

#+begin_quote
[[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice][install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice]]
#+end_quote

You can install the linux distribution:

- [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#windows-10-fall-creators-update-and-later-install-from-the-microsoft-store][from the Microsoft store]]
- [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#downloading-distros-via-the-command-line][from the command line]] (used in this guide)
- [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-on-server#download-a-linux-distro][manually (download)]]

** Installing from command line

Installing Ubuntu 18.04 from command line with PowerShell.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  curl.exe -L -o ubuntu-1804.appx https://aka.ms/wsl-ubuntu-1804
  Add-AppxPackage .\ubuntu-1804.appx
#+END_SRC

* Configure WSL

Start the WSL and configure it.

** Update

Make sure everything is up to date:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
#+END_SRC

** wsl.conf

With Windows 10 Build 17093 and later [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#set-wsl-launch-settings][certain functionality]] in WSL can be
configured inside the file "/etc/wsl.conf". The default is as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  # Enable extra metadata options by default.
  [automount]
  enabled = true
  mountFsTab = true
  root = /mnt/
  options = ""

  # Enable DNS  even though these are turned on by default, we’ll specify here just to be explicit.
  [network]
  generateHosts = true
  generateResolvConf = true

  [interop]
  enabled = true
  appendWindowsPath = true
#+END_SRC

*** [automount]

- enabled :: true causes fixed drives (i.e C:/ or D:/) to be automatically
     mounted with DrvFs under /mnt. false means drives won’t be mounted
     automatically, but you could still mount them manually or via fstab.
- mountFsTab :: true sets /etc/fstab to be processed on WSL start. /etc/fstab is
     a file where you can declare other filesystems, like an SMB share. Thus,
     you can mount these filesystems automatically in WSL on start up.
- root :: Sets the directory where fixed drives will be automatically mounted.
     For example, if you have a directory in WSL at /windir/ and you specify
     that as the root, you would expect to see your fixed drives mounted at
     /windir/c
- options :: This value is appended to the default DrvFs mount options string.
     Only DrvFs-specific options can be specified. Options that the mount binary
     would normally parse into a flag are not supported. If you want to
     explicitly specify those options, you must include every drive for which
     you want to do so in /etc/fstab.

*** [network]

- generateHosts :: true sets WSL to generate /etc/hosts. The hosts file contains
     a static map of hostnames corresponding IP address.
- generateResolvConf :: true set WSL to generate /etc/resolv.conf. The
     resolv.conf contains a DNS list that are capable of resolving a given
     hostname to its IP address.

*** [interop]

- enabled :: Setting this key will determine whether WSL will support launching
     Windows processes.
- appendWindowsPath :: Setting this key will determine whether WSL will add
     Windows path elements to the $PATH environment variable.

** User

Instead of using root user it's better to add an user.

*** Add user

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo adduser <username>
#+END_SRC

*** Change default user

Change the default user which is used when starting the WSL.

Open cmd.exe and run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ubuntu config --default-user <username>
#+END_SRC

Restart WSL.

*** Make it a sudo user

Make that user be a sudo user:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # change to root
  sudo su -
  sudo usermod -a -G sudo <username>
  exit
#+END_SRC

** Ssh key

Generate a new ED25519 SSH key pair:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@example.com"
#+END_SRC

A dialog will ask you to:

- input a file path: use the suggested path by pressing ~Enter~
- enter a password: enter your password

To copy the generated ssh key into the clipboard use:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  clip.exe < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
#+END_SRC

** Language

This might be needed:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF8
#+END_SRC

** Mount drives

*** Temporarily

You can mount network drives temporarily with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # mount a mapped drive
  sudo mkdir /mnt/g
  sudo mount -t drvfs G: /mnt/g
  # unmout
  sudo umount /mnt/g
  # mount network location
  sudo mount -t drvfs '\\server\share' /mnt/share
#+END_SRC

All mounted drives are found under ~/mnt~:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd /mnt
  ls
#+END_SRC

*** Automatically

To do so the fstab file needs to be configured.

For instance to mount ~H:~ add this to "/etc/fstab" (the directory has to exist to
make this work, so in this case ~sudo mkdir /mnt/h~ is needed beforehand):

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  H: /mnt/h drvfs defaults 0 0
#+END_SRC

** Zsh

If you want to use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell][zsh]] and [[https://ohmyz.sh/][oh-my-zsh]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo apt install zsh
  chsh -s $(which zsh)
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
#+END_SRC

Restart WSL.

* Install Emacs

This installs all dependencies for Emacs and then installs Emacs 26.3:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ## install dependencies

  sudo apt install -y build-essential texinfo libx11-dev libxpm-dev \
       libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libgif-dev libtiff-dev libgtk2.0-dev \
       libncurses-dev gnutls-dev libgtk-3-dev libgnutls28-dev

  # some more from a stackoverflow, eww was not working before

  sudo apt install -y autoconf automake libtool xorg-dev libncurses5-dev \
      libdbus-1-dev libm17n-dev librsvg2-dev libotf-dev libxml2-dev \
      libmagickwand-dev libc6-dev libtiff5-dev xaw3dg-dev \
      zlib1g-dev libice-dev libsm-dev libxext-dev libxi-dev libxmu-dev \
      libxmuu-dev libxrandr-dev libxt-dev libxtst-dev libxv-dev

  ## download and install

  cd ~
  wget https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/emacs-26.3.tar.gz
  tar -xzvf emacs-26.3.tar.gz
  cd emacs-26.3
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

  cd ~
  rm -rf ~/emacs-26.3
  rm ~/emacs-26.3.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

See[[file:emacs-27.sh][ emacs-27.sh]] to install Emacs 27 instead.

* Run Emacs in terminal

Run Emacs with ~emacs -nw~ to see if it is working. You can also see what path
it is using as home with ~C-h v user-emacs-directory~. That's where you can place
your init.el etc.

* Run Emacs in graphical display

To be able to run Emacs with a graphical display you need to install a linux
desktop and a Windows x server.

** Install Windows x server

An X server lets you access a Linux application or desktop environment’s graphic
user interface (GUI). Using open source VcXsrv:

- Download it from [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/]]
- Install it by executing the exe

** Install the linux desktop

Using lxde (lightweight one):

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo apt install lxde
#+END_SRC

** Run Emacs

*** Run the xserver

**** With XLaunch (GUI)

Start XLaunch and use the defaults:

- Multiple Windows, Display number -1 (or 0 if not working), Next
- Start no client, Next
- Leave checkboxes, Next
- Finish

**** Shortcut using command line

Just make a shortcut to vcxsrv.exe in the installation folder and then changes
its target to:

~"C:\Program Files\VcXsrv\vcxsrv.exe" :0 -multiwindow -clipboard -wgl~

You can put this link into the startup folder to start in when booting. And
stick it to the task bar to launch it from there.

*** Run Emacs from WSL

Open WSL and run (this also changes the keyboard layout used to US, remove if
yout don't want this. Then it should use your default keyboard layout):

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  export DISPLAY=:0
  export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
  # OPTIONAL Set the keyboard layout to US
  setxkbmap -layout us
  setsid emacs
  exit
#+END_SRC

This will open Emacs in a new window. By using setsid this is done in a new
session and therefore the WSL can be closed after with exit. You can just change
it to ~emacs~ and remove ~exit~ if you want.

To not have to type this over and over make an alias in "~/.bashrc" or if you
installed zsh in "~/.zshrc":

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  alias eme='
  export DISPLAY=:0.0
  export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
  setxkbmap -layout us
  setsid emacs
  exit
  '
#+END_SRC

Now you can fire wsl up and run ~eme~.

*** Start distribution & run Emacs in there

You can of course also run the distribution (after running the xserver) and then
run Emacs in there. To start the disttribution (in this case lxde).

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  export DISPLAY=:0
  export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
  # OPTIONAL Set the keyboard layout to US
  setxkbmap -layout us
  startlxde
#+END_SRC

* Remarks

** Accessing Linux files from Windows

Don't touch your Linux files from Windows. Creating and changing Linux files
from Windows can result in losing files or corrupting data.

This also means that if you want to for instance copy a file into your subsystem
this has to be done from inside the WSL.

Looks like this is getting better if one has Windows 10 Version 1903 or newer:

* FAQ

** Where is the root folder located?

It's in ~%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs~
See [[https://superuser.com/a/1280916]].

** How start WSL from Windows Explorer in the current folder?

To start WSL from Windows Explorer just type ~wsl~ into the location input box:

#+caption: WSL from windows explorer
[[./img/wsl-from-windows-explorer.png]]

The drive has to be mounted else it will not work.

** What ways are there to run WSL?

See [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#ways-to-run-wsl]].
