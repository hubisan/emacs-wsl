This guide shows you how to run Emacs with the Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL2
using Ubuntu as Linux distribution.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I removed the old detailled instructions on how to install WSL1 as with WSL2 a link to the documentation is good enough as it is easy to install.

* Enable WSL 1 or WSL 2

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
  dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
#+END_SRC

For ~WSL 2~ (see [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-2---check-requirements-for-running-wsl-2][requirements]]) you have to enable another feature:

#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
  dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
#+END_SRC

Restart the computer.

Download and install the [[https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi][Linux kernel update package]].

If you want to use ~WSL 2~ you should set it as default before intstalling
Ubuntu:

#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
  wsl --set-default-version 2
#+END_SRC

If you are not able to install WSL with this instructions go have a look at the
official Microsoft docs ([[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10][site]]) on how to install WSL.

* Install Ubuntu 20.04

To install Ubuntu 20.04 open PowerShell and run:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Use PowerShell Version 5 which is the preinstalled Version else the Appx module
might not be available and you will get an error when running this command.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
  curl.exe -L -o ubuntu-2004.appx https://aka.ms/wslubuntu2004
  Add-AppxPackage .\ubuntu-2004.appx
#+END_SRC

After installation open Start (@@html:<kbd>@@WIN@@html:</kbd>@@) and launch the
~Ubuntu 20.04 LTS~ terminal. After a short while you will be prompted to enter a
username and a password. This user will be your default user for the
distribution and is considered the Linux administrator with the ability to run
sudo commands.

Make sure everything is up to date:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
#+END_SRC

If you already have been using another Linux distribution you might want to
set Ubuntu 20.04 as default. Open PowerShell and run:

#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
  wsl --set-default Ubuntu-20.04
#+END_SRC

* Install Emacs 28.1

To install Emacs 28.1 in Ubuntu 20.04 follow those steps:

1. Install all dependencies (taken from the [[https://github.com/alexmurray/emacs-snap/blob/master/snapcraft.yaml][snap]]):
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell

  #+END_SRC
  There might be a dialog about the mail server configuration, just select ~no
  configuration~ to leave it as it is and confirm with OK (use TAB and RET to
  get through this).

2. Download and extract Emacs:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    cd ~
    wget https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/emacs-28.1.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf emacs-28.1.tar.gz
  #+END_SRC

3. Configure and install Emacs:\\ 
   This Step will take a while and you might be prompted to enter your password
   once. If you don't want to use ~native compilation~ just remove the
   compilation flag in the following instructions:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    cd ~/emacs-28.1
    export CC="gcc-10" CXX="gcc-10"
    ./configure --with-json --with-native-compilation --with-xwidgets
    make
    sudo make install
    rm ~/emacs-28.1.tar.gz
  #+END_SRC
  Keep the directory where Emacs was cloned to be able to reinstall (if a step
   fails), to reconfigure or to uninstall it.

To try out if Emacs is working just run it directly in the terminal with ~emacs
-nw~. 

** Update to a new Emacs version

To update to a new Emacs version uninstall the current one by going to the
folder you used for the installation (for instance =~/emacs-28.1=) and run ~sudo
make uninstall~.

Then [[#install-emacs-272][install]] the new version.

** Use latest Snapshot

To use the latest snapshot you can clone the git repository. Just replace step 2
from above with:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd ~
  git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/emacs.git
#+END_SRC
Then in step 3 make sure to =cd ~/emacs= instead. You can also add the
~--with-pgtk~ (pure GTK) compilation flag.

* Run Emacs in Terminal

Run Emacs with ~emacs -nw~ in Ubuntu terminal.

* Run Emacs in a Graphical Display

If you have Windows 11 you want to use [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps][WSLg]] to run Emacs in a graphical display
instead of installing an X-Server and VcXsrv. This makes the rest of this
section obsolete.

If you are on Windows 10 you need to install an X-Server and then run Emacs
using it.

** Install Windows X-Server VcXsrv

An X-server lets you access a Linux application or desktop environment’s graphic
user interface (GUI). This guide is using [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/][VcXsrv]] (free, open source, GPLv3).

*** Installation

Download VcXsrv from [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/]] and install it.
Check out the next section about the firewall configuration before launching
it (app is called XLaunch) for a first time to add the firewall rules.

*** Windows Defender Firewall Configuration

The first time you launch VcXsrv you are notified that Windows Defender Firewall
has blocked some features.

#+caption: Windows Defend Firewall Dialog
[[./img/vcxsrv-windows-defender-firewall.png]]

You have to allow VcXsrv to communicate on:

- ~WSL 1~ Private networks
- ~WSL 2~ Private and public networks.

After allowing access the following inbound rules are added:

~WSl 1~

[[./img/vcxsrv-wsl1-firewall-inbound-rules.png]]

~WSL 2~

[[./img/vcxsrv-wsl2-firewall-inbound-rules.png]]

If you missed this step or are not sure what you've chosen or if you are
switching from WSL 1 to WSL 2 you can retrigger this dialog by deleting the
inbound rules (admin rights needed) and restart VcXsrv. The inbound rules shown
above can be found at @@html:<kbd>@@WIN@@html:</kbd>@@ Windows Defender Firewall
> Advanced Settings (or @@html:<kbd>@@WIN-r wf.msc RET@@html:</kbd>@@).

**** WSL 2 Additional Firewall Configuration

To make VcXsrv work with ~WSL 2~ you have to disable access control. Disabling the
user access control with the ~-ac~ flag has some [[https://www.xfree86.org/current/Xserver.1.html][security issues]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
-ac disables host-based access control mechanisms. Enables access by any host,
and permits any host to modify the access control list. Use with extreme
caution. This option exists primarily for running test suites remotely.
#+END_QUOTE

Therefore we want to restrict the access as much as possible. Unfortunately you
can't modify the firewall rules if you have ~no admin rights~. In that case you
have to live with the security issue (not sure how severe it is).

If you have ~admin rights~ you can add an inbound firewall rule to restrict
access as much as possible. As the IP used by WSL 2 is dynamic a powershell
script is provided later on to create/update the rule.

If you want to use the additional firewall rule make sure that you disable
the existing inbound rules:

1. Go to the inbound rule settings with @@html:<kbd>@@WIN@@html:</kbd>@@ Windows
   Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings (or @@html:<kbd>@@WIN-r wf.msc
   RET@@html:</kbd>@@).
2. Search for VcXsrv entries (there should be two) and disable all found.

** Run Emacs in Graphical Display Using VcXsrv

To run Emacs in a graphical display you have to:

1. ~WSL 2 only, optional~ Created/update the inbound firewall rule (admin rights needed)
2. Run VcXsrv
3. Run Emacs

For convenience there are batch scripts (double-clickable) to (you can copy
the run-emacs folder for WSL 1 or WSL 2 to wherever you want):

- ~WSL 1~
  1. Run VcXsrv and Emacs [[./run-emacs-wsl-1/wsl-1_0-run-all.bat]]
  2. Run VcXsrv [[./run-emacs-wsl-1/wsl-1_1-vcxsrv.bat]]
  3. Run Emacs [[./run-emacs-wsl-1/wsl-1_2-emacs.bat]]

- ~WSL 2~
  1. Run all (Firewall rule, VcXsrv and Emacs) [[./run-emacs-wsl-2/wsl-2_0-run-all.bat]]
  2. Run Firewall rule and VcXsrv [[./run-emacs-wsl-2/wsl-2_1-firewall-rule-vcxsrv.bat]]
  3. Run Firewall rule (admin rights needed). [[./run-emacs-wsl-2/wsl-2_2-firewall-rule.bat]]
  4. Run VcXsrv [[./run-emacs-wsl-2/wsl-2_3-vcxsrv.bat]]
  5. Run Emacs [[./run-emacs-wsl-2/wsl-2_4-emacs.bat]]

*** ~WSL 2 only~ Create/update the Inbound Firewall Rule

As described in [[#wsl-2-additional-firewall-configuration][WSL 2 Additional Firewall Configuration]] we want to restrict the
access by adding a firewall rule. Make sure you have disabled the existing
VcXsrv firewall rules.

To create or update the inbound firewall rule you can use the batch script
[[./run-emacs-wsl-2/wsl-2_2-firewall-rule.bat]]. If VcXsrv was running before the firewall
rule was updated it has to be restarted.

*** Run VcXsrv

To run VcXsrv use the batch script provided or run the following commands in cmd
(if you haven't used the default installation path you have to adapt the
script/command):

- ~WSL 1~ [[./run-emacs-wsl-1/wsl-1_1-vcxsrv.bat]]
  #+BEGIN_SRC bat
    start "" "C:\Program Files\VcXsrv\vcxsrv.exe" :0 -multiwindow -clipboard -wgl
  #+END_SRC
- ~WSL 2~ [[./run-emacs-wsl-2/wsl-2_3-vcxsrv.bat]]
  #+BEGIN_SRC bat
    start "" "C:\Program Files\VcXsrv\vcxsrv.exe" :0 -multiwindow -clipboard -wgl -ac
  #+END_SRC
  If you are using the additional firewall rule make sure to create/update the
  rule before launching VcXsrv.

If VcXsrv is already running it will show an error message. In that case stop
VcXsrv if needed and run the script again.

*** Run Emacs

To run Emacs you can launch Ubuntu terminal and run the following commands or
use the batch script:

- ~WSL 1~ [[./run-emacs-wsl-1/wsl-1_2-emacs.bat]]
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    export DISPLAY=:0.0
    export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
    setsid emacs
  #+END_SRC
- ~WSL 2~ [[./run-emacs-wsl-2/wsl-2_4-emacs.bat]]
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    export DISPLAY=$(ip route | awk '/^default/{print $3; exit}'):0.0
    export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
    setsid emacs
  #+END_SRC

You can add the lines without ~setsid emacs~ to =~/.bashrc= and then just use
~setsid emacs~ to launch Emacs in the background. If you do so VcXsrv has to
be running before launching the terminal else this will give an error when
starting the terminal and in that case slow the startup down.

To not have to type this over and over add an alias in =~/.bashrc= and then
run Emacs with ~ema~ (needs a restart):

- ~WSL 1~
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    alias ema="
    export DISPLAY=:0.0
    export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
    setsid emacs
    "
  #+END_SRC
- ~WSL 2~
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    alias ema="
    export DISPLAY=$(ip route | awk '/^default/{print $3; exit}'):0.0
    export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
    setsid emacs
    "
  #+END_SRC

* Optional Additions

** Preserve X11 Connections to Hyper-V
The network connection between Windows and WSL2 breaks when your machine goes
into standby or hibernate. Graphical Emacs & other GUI apps will terminate.

Should you want to preserve your GUI Emacs sessions between sleep, there are
three options:

1. Use X2Go - virtual X11 server with Windows client

   This is the most preferred option

   a) Fix SSH host keys

      #+begin_src bash
      sudo apt-get remove --purge openssh-server
      sudo apt-get install openssh-server
      sudo service ssh --full-restart
      #+end_src

   b) Install X2Go on your Linux distribution

      #+begin_src bash
      apt install x2goserver
      #+end_src

   c) [[code.x2go.org/releases/X2GoClient_latest_mswin32-setup.exe][Download]] and install the client for Windows.

   d) Configure the

       Host: localhost
       Login: <your user>
       Session type: Published Applications

   e) After each WSL/Windows restart

      Launch ssh in Linux (if not started yet): sudo service ssh start
      Launch “X2Go Client” on Windows ad connect to the server with user/password
      Now you can launch X11 apps via the tray icon (see X2Go Published Applications)

   Source: [[https://derkoe.dev/blog/development-environment-in-wsl2/][Development Environment in WSL2]]

2. Forward X11 unix socket from WSL2 via WSL1 to X410/Vcxsrv/etc. running on Windows

   [[http://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/23/using-emacs-on-windows-with-wsl2/?ht-comment-id=688089][Using Emacs on Windows with WSL2 | Emacs Redux]]
   [[https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4619#issuecomment-678652118][microsoft/WSL#4619 {WSL 2} WSL 2 cannot access windows service via localhost:...]]

3. WSL Daemon - Stable X11 connection for WSL2

   [[https://github.com/nbdd0121/wsld][GitHub - nbdd0121/wsld: WSL Daemon - Stable X11 connection and time synchroni...]]

** Use Windows Terminal

Install [[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab][Windows Terminal]] from Microsoft from the Microsoft Store.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Windows Terminal is a modern, fast, efficient, powerful, and productive
terminal application for users of command-line tools and shells like Command
Prompt, PowerShell, and WSL.
#+END_QUOTE

To make it open WSL by default:

- Open the Windows Terminal.
- Open the settings by clicking on the dropdown button in the tab bar and then
  select settings (bound to @@html:<kbd>@@Ctrl-,@@html:</kbd>@@).
- Copy the GUID for WSL (example: {12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890AB}).
- Set the default profile to the one copied from WSL:
  #+BEGIN_SRC js
    {
        ...
        "defaultProfile": "{12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890AB}",
        ...
  #+END_SRC

To change the default path to =~=:

- Go to the settings (@@html:<kbd>@@Ctrl-,@@html:</kbd>@@).
- Add a line in the WSL part at the end (make sure to also add the ~,~ on the
  previous line):
  #+BEGIN_SRC js
    {
        ...
        "source": "Windows.Terminal.Wsl",
        "startingDirectory": "//wsl$/Ubuntu-20.04/home/<username>/"
    },
  #+END_SRC

** Change keyboard layout

If you want to change the keyboard layout used make sure ~x11-xkb-utils~ is
installed (~sudo apt install x11-xkb-utils~) and add for instance

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  setxkbmap -layout us
#+END_SRC

to =~/.bashrc= or to the alias to use the US keyboard layout. Or add it to
the scripts used to run Emacs (~... && setxkbmap -layout us && setsid
emacs~).

** Generate SSH Key

Generate a new ED25519 SSH key pair:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@example.com"
#+END_SRC

A dialog will ask you to:

- input a file path: use the suggested path by pressing ~Enter~
- enter a password: enter your password

To copy the generated ssh key into the clipboard use:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  clip.exe < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
#+END_SRC

** Use en_US Language

Bash on Ubuntu on Windows starts on the language defined in your Country or
Region settings (maybe this got changed, not 100 % sure). If you want to change
the default language to en_US you may need to run the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo apt install -y language-pack-en language-pack-en-base manpages
  sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
  sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF8
#+END_SRC

** Mount Network Drives Automatically

To do so the fstab file needs to be configured.

For instance to mount ~H:~ add this to "/etc/fstab" (the directory has to exist to
make this work, so in this case ~sudo mkdir /mnt/h~ is needed beforehand):

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  H: /mnt/h drvfs defaults 0 0
#+END_SRC

From now on that network drive is automatically mounted.

** Zsh and oh-my-zsh

If you want to use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell][zsh]] and [[https://ohmyz.sh/][oh-my-zsh]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo apt install zsh
  chsh -s $(which zsh)
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
#+END_SRC

Restart WSL.

In some scripts you need to change bash to zsh to be able to use it when
emulating a terminal in Emacs.

* FAQ

** Where is the root folder located?

The root is accessible as ~\\wsl$~ in file explorer followed by the
distribution. You can show the current distribution name by running ~wsl -l -q~
in cmd.

** How to access Linux files from Windows?

Run ~explorer.exe .~ in WSL to open the Windows File Explorer at the current
location. The path will start with ~\\wsl$~ unless it is a mounted drive. In the
File Explorer the files and folders can be copied, moved and edited as usual
(see this blog [[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-for-wsl-in-windows-10-version-1903/][post]]).

** How start WSL from File Explorer in the current folder?

To start WSL from Windows File Explorer just type ~wsl~ into the location input
box or hold down ~Shift~ while right-clicking and select ~Open Linux shell here~
from the context menu. If it's a network drive it has to be mounted else this
will not work.

#+caption: WSL from windows explorer
