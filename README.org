This guide shows you how to run Emacs with the Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL
in Windows 10. Emacs can either be run with a graphical display or directly in
the terminal.

This guide is using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS as Linux distribution.

* Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux

#+begin_quote
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
#+end_quote

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following to enable the feature:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
#+END_SRC

Restart your computer (you should be prompted to do so).

This can also be done with:

- Open Control Panel
- Programs and Features
- Turn Windows Feature on or off
- Check Windows Subsystem for Linux

* Install the Linux distribution

#+begin_quote
[[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice][install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice]]
#+end_quote

You can install the Linux distribution:

- [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#windows-10-fall-creators-update-and-later-install-from-the-microsoft-store][from the Microsoft store]]
- [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#downloading-distros-via-the-command-line][from the command line]] (used in this guide)
- [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-on-server#download-a-linux-distro][manually (download)]]

** Installing from command line

Installing Ubuntu 18.04 from command line with PowerShell.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  curl.exe -L -o ubuntu-1804.appx https://aka.ms/wsl-ubuntu-1804
  Add-AppxPackage .\ubuntu-1804.appx
#+END_SRC

* Configure WSL

Start the WSL and configure it.

** Update

Make sure everything is up to date:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
#+END_SRC

** wsl.conf

With Windows 10 Build 17093 and later [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#set-wsl-launch-settings][certain functionality]] (automount options
and network configuration) in WSL can be configured inside the file
~/etc/wsl.conf~.

No need to touch that file, just leave the defaults.

** User

Instead of using root user it's better to add an user and use that as default
user.

*** Add user

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo adduser <username>
#+END_SRC

*** Make it a sudo user

Make that user be a sudo user:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo usermod -a -G sudo <username>
#+END_SRC

*** Change default user

Change the default user which is used when starting the WSL.

Open ~cmd.exe~ and run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ubuntu config --default-user <username>
#+END_SRC

Restart WSL.

You can change the default back to root by using ~root~ as username. To change
to root inside wsl temporarily use ~sudo su -~.

** Ssh key

Generate a new ED25519 SSH key pair:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@example.com"
#+END_SRC

A dialog will ask you to:

- input a file path: use the suggested path by pressing ~Enter~
- enter a password: enter your password

To copy the generated ssh key into the clipboard use:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  clip.exe < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
#+END_SRC

** Language

This might be needed:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF8
#+END_SRC

** Mount drives

*** Temporarily

You can mount network drives temporarily with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # mount a mapped drive
  sudo mkdir /mnt/g
  sudo mount -t drvfs G: /mnt/g
  # unmout
  sudo umount /mnt/g
  # mount network location
  sudo mount -t drvfs '\\server\share' /mnt/share
#+END_SRC

All mounted drives are found under ~/mnt~:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd /mnt
  ls
#+END_SRC

*** Automatically

To do so the fstab file needs to be configured.

For instance to mount ~H:~ add this to "/etc/fstab" (the directory has to exist to
make this work, so in this case ~sudo mkdir /mnt/h~ is needed beforehand):

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  H: /mnt/h drvfs defaults 0 0
#+END_SRC

** Zsh

If you want to use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell][zsh]] and [[https://ohmyz.sh/][oh-my-zsh]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo apt install zsh
  chsh -s $(which zsh)
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
#+END_SRC

Restart WSL.

* Install Emacs

This installs all dependencies for Emacs and then installs Emacs 26.3:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ## install dependencies (got those from all over the net)

  sudo apt install -y autoconf automake autotools-dev bsd-mailx build-essential \
      diffstat gnutls-dev imagemagick libasound2-dev libc6-dev libdatrie-dev \
      libdbus-1-dev libgconf2-dev libgif-dev libgnutls28-dev libgpm-dev libgtk2.0-dev \
      libgtk-3-dev libice-dev libjpeg-dev liblockfile-dev liblqr-1-0 libm17n-dev \
      libmagickwand-dev libncurses5-dev libncurses-dev libotf-dev libpng-dev \
      librsvg2-dev libsm-dev libthai-dev libtiff5-dev libtiff-dev libtinfo-dev libtool \
      libx11-dev libxext-dev libxi-dev libxml2-dev libxmu-dev libxmuu-dev libxpm-dev \
      libxrandr-dev libxt-dev libxtst-dev libxv-dev quilt sharutils texinfo xaw3dg \
      xaw3dg-dev xorg-dev xutils-dev zlib1g-dev libjansson-dev libxaw7-dev \
      libselinux1-dev libmagick++-dev libacl1-dev

  ## download and install

  cd ~
  wget https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/emacs-26.3.tar.gz
  tar -xzvf emacs-26.3.tar.gz
  cd emacs-26.3
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

  cd ~
  rm -rf ~/emacs-26.3
  rm ~/emacs-26.3.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

See[[file:emacs-27.sh][ emacs-27.sh]] to install Emacs 27 instead.

* Run Emacs in terminal

Run Emacs with ~emacs -nw~ to see if it is working. You can also see what path
it is using as home with ~C-h v user-emacs-directory~. That's where you can place
your init.el etc.

* Run Emacs in graphical display

To be able to run Emacs with a graphical display you need to install a Windows X
server.

** Install Windows X-server

An X-server lets you access a Linux application or desktop environment’s graphic
user interface (GUI).

You can use [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/][VcXsrv]] or [[https://x.cygwin.com/][Cygwin/X]]. Both are free and based on xorg.

*** Install VcXsrv

Download VcXsrv from [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/]] and install it.

*** Install Cygwin/X

You have to install Cygwin and install additional packages:

- Download Cygwin from https://cygwin.com/install.html.
- Run the setup to install Cygwin. When you come to the ~select packages~ step
  you have to add (change from skip to the newest version) ~xorg-server~ and
  ~xinit~. If you want to use the wizard (GUI) for launching the X-Server add
  ~xlaunch~ as well.
- If you missed that step you can easily add those packages later on by running
  the setup again.

** Run Emacs

*** Run the X-server

**** With XLaunch (GUI)

Start XLaunch and use the defaults:

- Multiple Windows, Display number -1 (or 0 if not working), Next
- Start no client, Next
- Leave checkboxes, Next
- Finish

**** With a Shortcut

Make a shortcut (right click on your desktop > New > Shortcut) and use the
following as target.

- With VcXsrv:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    # Change the path if installed somewhere else.
    "C:\Program Files\VcXsrv\vcxsrv.exe" :0 -multiwindow -clipboard -wgl
  #+END_SRC

- With Cygwin/X:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    # Change the path if installed somewhere else.
    "C:\cygwin64\bin\run.exe" --quote /usr/bin/bash.exe -l -c "XWin :0 -listen tcp -multiwindow -clipboard -wgl"
  #+END_SRC

You can put the shortcut into the startup folder to start it when booting. Or
stick it to the task bar to launch it from there.

**** From command line

You can use the command from the [[*With a Shortcut][Shortcut]] also from the command line.

*** Run Emacs from WSL

Open WSL and run (this also changes the keyboard layout used to US, remove if
yout don't want this. Then it should use your default keyboard layout):

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  export DISPLAY=:0
  export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
  # OPTIONAL Set the keyboard layout to US
  setxkbmap -layout us
  setsid emacs
  exit
#+END_SRC

This will open Emacs in a new window. By using setsid this is done in a new
session and therefore the WSL can be closed after with exit. You can just change
it to ~emacs~ and remove ~exit~ if you want.

To not have to type this over and over make an alias in =~/.bashrc= or if you
installed zsh in =~/.zshrc=:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  alias eme='
  export DISPLAY=:0.0
  export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
  setxkbmap -layout us
  setsid emacs
  exit
  '
#+END_SRC

Now you can fire wsl up and run ~eme~.

* Remarks

** Accessing Linux files from Windows

Don't touch your Linux files from Windows. Creating and changing Linux files
from Windows can result in losing files or corrupting data.

This also means that if you want to for instance copy a file into your subsystem
this has to be done from inside the WSL.

Looks like this is getting better if one has Windows 10 Version 1903 or newer:

* FAQ

** Where is the root folder located?

It's in ~%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs~
See [[https://superuser.com/a/1280916]].

** How start WSL from Windows Explorer in the current folder?

To start WSL from Windows Explorer just type ~wsl~ into the location input box:

#+caption: WSL from windows explorer
[[./img/wsl-from-windows-explorer.png]]

The drive has to be mounted else it will not work.

** What ways are there to run WSL?

See [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#ways-to-run-wsl]].
